\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to describe the design of a web application that can handle the needs of the Hall Management Center of IIT Kharagpur by automating various book-keeping activities associated with the management of the different halls.
This is the first version of the application.
The application's scope covers an end-to-end system that is self-contained, possessing all the required interfaces and a corresponding backend for interacting with the system to achieve various management tasks.

\section{Document Conventions}
\textbf{Bold} text is used for software frameworks and tools.
\textit{Italicized} text is used for specific end-users of the application.
\section{Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions}
This SRS is for developers and testers who will be directly working on the implementation of the application. It is suggested that the reader familiarize themselves with the standard operating procedures of the halls in IIT KGP since this would help rationalize the various design decisions described in this document.

\section{Product Scope}
This software system will be a Hall Management System for our institute. This system will be
designed to streamline the process of everything related to the working of halls in our institute.
It will serve as a portal for the students, wardens, hall clerks and the HMC Chairman to access
information relevant to the respective parties.
More specifically, this system is designed to facilitate communication between the different
entities such as students and wardens, which would ensure smoother running of the halls and
provide an organised way to handle expenses and allocations.

\chapter{Overall Description}

\section{Product Perspective}
This application is needed to centralize the various book-keeping operations that are prone to errors and malicious failures. Manual management of these activities separately by the different halls in IIT KGP can lead to redundancies, lack of uniformity, etc. Students do not possess a simple mechanism to manage their interactions with their halls. For example, filing complaints would require the students to personally approach various individuals for resolution, sometimes with no accountability since there are no centralized complaint records available. Similarly, there are various such use cases that offer the potential for digitisation and the benefits associated with it. This document describes our vision for a web application that will handle all these situations in an accessible manner.
\section{Product Functions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Complaint resolution
    \item Fee management
    \item Grant management
    \item Expenditure control
    \item Staff management
\end{enumerate}
\section{User Classes and Characteristics}
The following user classes have been differentiated based on the subset of product features used. Each user class possesses a different interface into the application and are exposed to functions that are relevant to them.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{Mess managers}: Need to handle the dues, fees, and complaints relevant to the messes handled by them.
  \item \textit{Students}: Pay various fees and dues, register and view complaints.
  \item \textit{Hall clerks}: Manage the employment of temporary workers
  \item \textit{Wardens}: Handle complaints, manage payments to mess managers, handle financial grants from the HMC
  \item \textit{HMC chairman}: View various expenditures, allocation of grants to different halls 
  \item \textit{Administrators}: Manage student records and hall allocation
\end{enumerate}

    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{classes.png}
    \caption{User classes}
    \label{fig:user_classes}
\end{figure}

\section{Operating Environment}
The application is designed to use the platform agnostic \textbf{Python} interpreter along with frameworks associated with it. The application server that handles incoming requests can be run on any platform that possesses a TCP/IP stack with support for \textbf{Django} and \textbf{Python}. The web application can therefore be run on \textbf{Windows Server} or \textbf{Linux}-based distributions which support the above tools.
The server should be connected to the local area network provided by the Computer and Informatics Centre in IIT KGP and should be appropriately configured to handle incoming requests. Any relevant firewall settings must be tweaked to allow high traffic to the server without dropping any requests.

\section{Design and Implementation Constraints}
Developers are limited to using Python for providing the backend services for the web application for the following reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Professors have enforced a rule necessitating the usage of either \textbf{C++}, \textbf{Java} or \textbf{Python}. This eliminates the possibility of writing the codebase with just \textbf{HTML}, \textbf{CSS} and \textbf{JavaScript} for the front-end combined with \textbf{JavaScript} on the backend (\textbf{Node.js}, etc.)
    \item \textbf{C++} and \textbf{Java} do not possess easy to use, batteries included frameworks like \textbf{Python}. The development time available for this project is less than three weeks. This necessitates the usage of pre-built mechanisms and libraries that Python possesses.

With these two constraints in mind, we have decided to use \textbf{Python} along with the \textbf{Django} framework for the web application.
\end{enumerate}
% \chapter{System Features}
% "IICT WEBSITE" is a result processing web software. So the main art of this product is to enter data of results and publish. 

\section{User Documentation}
The web application will possess a self-documenting, easy to use interface that does not require a specific set of manuals for any of the users. All the relevant information regarding the usage of the web application will be placed at the appropriate locations inside the different webpages and displayed when needed.


\section{Assumptions and Dependencies}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The existence of a local network within the KGP campus. If this is absent, additional configuration would be required in terms of DNS, hosting, ISP handling, etc.
    \item End users should be able to connect to this network, otherwise access to the application will be limited to those with direct access to the servers. 
    \item The network should not have significant downtimes that can affect the utility of the application and its ability to handle incoming requests.
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{External Interface Requirements}

\section{User Interfaces}
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.35]{user-interface.png}
    \caption{User interfaces}
    \label{fig:ui_diag}
\end{figure}

\section{Hardware Interfaces}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The hardware used for this needs to be server computer with a processor fast enough to handle a large number of requests simultaneously. Preferably a multi-core system with distributed processes across the core will be suitable.
    \item Solid state drives instead of hard disks to boost the speed of information retrieval. Enables faster request handling.
    \item RAID systems to manage data redundancy. Ensures no user data is lost because of storage device failures by maintaining redundant copies as backup.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Software Interfaces}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Web browsers needed on the end-users' systems to access the web application
    \item Graphical user interfaces combined with the browsers needed. Command-line interface won't be able to meaningfully handle the user interfaces provided in the web application.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Communications Interfaces}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Will be using a standard TCP/IP stack available on most operating systems.
    \item Will use the \textbf{HTTPS} protocol to deliver webpages and handle user login
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Other Nonfunctional Requirements}

\section{Performance Requirements}
\subsection{Server Up-time}
The system needs to keep running for long periods of time for accessibility so the hardware needs to be capable of that. Moreover the maintenance frequency needs to be low to have a stable experience for the end users.\subsection{Response Time}
The system needs to have a good response time as it will be repetitively used by various stakeholders in the Institute and the response time needs to keep up with the incoming requests. At the same time less used tasks like printing bills at the end of the month can be a little slow since they will be accessed much less frequently.
\subsection{System Dependability}
It determines the failure rate of the system, that is, the cases when the system receives an incorrect input or there is a random failure. The end user needs to be notified in such a scenario.
\subsection{Prominent Documents}
Since the system is also being used to maintain cash receipts and expenditure through the halls and generate official documents for the students' stay in their halls, the output needs to be clear, concise and consistent in a .pdf or another similar printable format.



\section{Safety Requirements}
There needs to be a regular audit to the cash flow through the hall since there is no check for the information entered by the mess manager. Moreover, audit also needs to be done for the budget distribution as there might be cases for fraud in the long run if left unchecked since the system is not verifying the data in any manner.

\section{Security Requirements}
\subsection{Secure Login}
The system should be protected against forced and malicious login attempts to access the software. The web interface needs to be continuously patched to fix bugs as and when they crop up.
\subsection{Verifiable Access}
The system is designed to serve multiple parties and their levels of access and their permissions are decided by their login IDs. Thus, the login and access to functionality should be robust and extremely secure since the system also deals with the finances of the institute.
\subsection{Student Information Must be Secure}
All the personal student information stored by the system should be safe and secure.

\section{Software Quality Attributes}
\subsection{Reliability}
The system must be dependable, which means it must constantly perform as expected with very low downtime and rate of failure. In absence of this the HCM will not be able to function smoothly.
\subsection{Information Accessibility}
To save the login credentials and the myriad types of data that the software uses, the application should be able to save, access and alter files on the system so that the information is retained even on successive runs.
\subsection{Maintainability}
The program should be easy to modify and add features to. The code should be clearly commented and the features well documented to allow for easy maintenance. The frameworks used should be well supported by their developers well into the future.
